## Scalable Frontend Architecture

This Architecture is based on scalability of larger production app.

The top level directory structure will be as follows:

assets - global static assets such as images, svgs, company logo, etc.
components - global shared/reusable components, such as layout (wrappers, navigation), form components, buttons
services - JavaScript modules
store - Global Redux store
utils - Utilities, helpers, constants, and the like
views - Can also be called "pages", the majority of the app would be contained here


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`
